# Binance Market Data Service

![CI](https://github.com/szavads/cqg-binance-market-data/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

A C++ Linux service that connects to the Binance WebSocket API, subscribes to trade streams, and aggregates real-time market statistics to a file.

## Architecture

The service is split into four independent components with unidirectional data flow:

```
Binance WebSocket API
        │  (JSON over wss://)
        ▼
  WebSocketClient          – connects, parses raw JSON, fires TradeCallback
        │  (symbol, price, qty, isBuyerMaker, exchangeTimeMs)
        ▼
    Aggregator              – accumulates stats per symbol in tumbling time windows
        │  (map<symbol, TradeStats> per window)
        ▼
    FileWriter              – buffers and serialises stats to disk at hardware-clock intervals
        │
        ▼
   logs/market_data.log
```

### Component responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `WebSocketClient` | TLS WebSocket connection to `stream.binance.com`. Parses Binance trade events (`@trade` stream). Exponential-backoff reconnect using websocketpp timers (no blocking sleep, no recursive calls). Responds to Binance ping frames automatically (required by the API — server disconnects if pong is not received within 60s). Graceful shutdown via `wsClient_.stop()`. |
| `Aggregator` | Maintains per-symbol `TradeStats` (tradeCount, totalVolume, minPrice, maxPrice, buyerInitiated, sellerInitiated). Window boundaries are derived from **exchange timestamps** — each trade is bucketed as `(exchangeTimeMs / windowMs) * windowMs`. A dedicated joinable thread fires `processWindows()` every `windowMs` using `condition_variable::wait_for` for instant shutdown response. |
| `FileWriter` | Receives aggregated stats from `Aggregator` via callback, buffers them as a queue of batches, and flushes to a file every `serialization_interval_ms`. Batches sharing the same exchange window end time are merged before writing — preventing duplicate `timestamp=` blocks when symbols arrive in separate callbacks. The output file is opened once at construction (append mode) and closed after the writer thread joins. |
| `Config` | Loads `config.json` at startup. Validates required fields. Throws `std::runtime_error` on missing file or invalid values. |

### Threading model

```
main thread
  ├─ wsThread          → WebSocketClient::start() → wsClient_.run() (io_context loop)
  ├─ Aggregator::workerThread_   → processWindows() every windowMs
  └─ FileWriter::writerThread_   → flush pendingStats_ every intervalMs
```

All shared state is protected by `std::mutex`. `isRunning_` flags are `std::atomic<bool>`. Shutdown sequence: `aggregator.stop()` → `client.stop()` → `writer.stop()` → `wsThread.join()`.

### Design decisions

**Output file opened once for the lifetime of the service.**  
`FileWriter` opens the file in its constructor and holds the `std::ofstream` open until `stop()` is called and the writer thread has joined. This eliminates repeated `open`/`close` overhead on every flush interval and guarantees that a file-system error (e.g. disk full, path removed) is detected immediately at startup rather than silently mid-run. The file is opened in **append mode** — data from previous runs is preserved across restarts. A `# session started <UTC>` line is written on open to make session boundaries visible.

**Timestamps are exchange-derived, not local-clock.**  
Each `timestamp=` line in the output reflects the **end of the aggregation window** computed from Binance exchange timestamps (`windowStartTime + windowMs`). This makes the output deterministic and identical across multiple service instances regardless of local clock drift or flush timing.

**Log rotation.**  
Log growth is managed externally via `logrotate` — the service itself does not rotate files. See `/etc/logrotate.d/` for configuration. The `copytruncate` directive should be used since the file is held open for the service lifetime.

### Why these libraries

- **websocketpp + Boost.Asio** — header-only WebSocket library with TLS support, integrates naturally with Boost.Asio's io_context. Required by the task (boost).
- **nlohmann/json** — single-header JSON parser, clean API, exception-safe.
- **OpenSSL** — TLS backend for wss:// connections via Boost.Asio SSL context.
- **GTest** — industry-standard unit testing framework for C++.
- **spdlog** — structured logging with timestamp and level. Used across all components (`info`, `warn`, `error`).

```

## Configuration

`config/config.json`:

```json
{
  "trading_pairs": ["btcusdt", "ethusdt"],
  "aggregation_window_ms": 1000,
  "serialization_interval_ms": 5000,
  "output_file": "logs/market_data.log"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `trading_pairs` | List of Binance stream names (lowercase). Streams `<pair>@trade` are subscribed automatically. |
| `aggregation_window_ms` | Duration of one aggregation window in milliseconds (uses exchange timestamp). |
| `serialization_interval_ms` | How often aggregated stats are flushed to file (hardware clock). |
| `output_file` | Output file path (relative to working directory). |

## Output Format

```
# session started 2026-04-16T06:00:00Z
timestamp=2026-04-16T06:00:01Z
symbol=BTCUSDT trades=154 volume=23.51 min=43012.1 max=43189.4 buy=82 sell=72
symbol=ETHUSDT trades=231 volume=112.70 min=2289.2 max=2301.8 buy=120 sell=111
timestamp=2026-04-16T06:00:02Z
symbol=BTCUSDT trades=87 volume=10.20 min=43010.0 max=43015.0 buy=40 sell=47
```

- The `# session started` line is written once per process startup.
- Each `timestamp=` value is the **exchange-derived end time** of the 1-second aggregation window — identical across all service instances.
- Windows with no trades for a symbol are skipped.
- The file is appended on each run; session boundaries are visible via the header line.

## Build

Install dependencies with Conan, then build with CMake:

```bash
pip install conan
conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing -s build_type=Release
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Run

```bash
./build/Release/binance_service
```

The service handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown (flushes pending data before exit).

## Testing

```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

35 unit tests across four suites:

| Suite | Tests | What is covered |
|---|---|---|
| `ConfigTest` | 6 | Valid load, defaults, invalid path, invalid JSON, validation |
| `FileWriterTest` | 11 | File creation, error handling, flush, format, shutdown, exchange-derived timestamp, same-window merge, separate blocks for different windows |
| `AggregatorTest` | 11 | Trade accumulation, window reset, buy/sell semantics, callback, stats reset after flush |
| `TradeParserTest` | 7 | Valid trade, buyer/seller flags, non-trade events, missing fields, malformed JSON, empty payload |

## Docker

Build and run the service in a container (Linux target, TLS verify_peer enabled):

```bash
docker build -t binance_service .
docker run --rm binance_service
```

To override the config without rebuilding the image:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/config/config.json:/app/config/config.json \
  binance_service
```

To persist the output log on the host:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  binance_service
```
